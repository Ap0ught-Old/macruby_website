h2. MacRuby Development

MacRuby development happens in the trunk SVN branch. However, be careful, because trunk may not work (or even compile) all of the time.

<code><pre class="commands">
$ svn co http://svn.macosforge.org/repository/ruby/MacRuby/trunk MacRuby-trunk
</pre></code>


For building instructions, please refer to

h2. Git

Git aficionados will be glad to learn that there is a mirror of the SVN trunk repository on GitHub, maintained by Claudio Poli: "MacRuby Git Repository":http://github.com/masterkain/macruby/tree/master

h2. Roadmap

Check out the "MacRubyRoadmap":http://www.macruby.org/trac/wiki/MacRubyRoadmap

h2. Mailing Lists

"MacRuby-devel":http://lists.macosforge.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/macruby-devel is the developer mailing-list. Please subscribe to it, if you are interested in following the MacRuby development process or would like to start a discussion. All activity in the tracker generates notifications in this list.

"MacRuby-changes":http://lists.macosforge.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/macruby-changes is the SVN changes mailing-list. This is a read-only list, but you might want to subscribe to it if you are interested in tracking all of the changes in the project's source code.

h2. Contributions

Please "file a ticket":http://trac.macosforge.org/projects/ruby/newticket on the MacRuby Trac component, if you want to contribute an enhancement request or a bug report. Patches with test cases are welcome.

You can also send your feedback to the MacRuby-devel mailing-list.

If you want to help us, do not hesitate to introduce yourself in the mailing-list; we will give you an overview of things that need to be done. If you want to commit your code directly in the repository, please note that you will have to sign a committer agreement first; we will provide this to you.
