h2. MacRuby Development

MacRuby development happens in the trunk SVN branch. However, be careful, because trunk may not work (or even compile) all of the time.

<code><pre class="commands">
$ svn co http://svn.macosforge.org/repository/ruby/MacRuby/trunk MacRuby-trunk
</pre></code>


For building instructions, please refer to README.macruby file, but the basic build instructions are:

<code><pre class="commands">
$ rake
$ sudo rake install
</pre></code>

h2. Git

Git aficionados will be glad to learn that there is a mirror of the SVN trunk repository on GitHub, maintained by Claudio Poli: "MacRuby Git Repository":http://github.com/masterkain/macruby/tree/master
