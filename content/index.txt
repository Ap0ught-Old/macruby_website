<p class="callout"><strong>MacRuby</strong> is an implementation of Ruby 1.9 directly on top of Mac OS X core technologies such as the Objective-C runtime and garbage collector, the LLVM compiler infrastructure and the Foundation and ICU frameworks. It is the goal of MacRuby to enable the creation of full-fledged Mac OS X applications which do not sacrifice performance in order to enjoy the benefits of using Ruby. <a href="/documentation/overview.html"><i>Read more...</i></a></p>

<h2>HotCocoa Is For Me!</h2>
<p>If you've done any amount of programming on OS X, you know that the API can be quite verbose. HotCocoa simplifies this down to very elegant and simple methods that then return super sexy UI elements. <br/> <a href="/hotcocoa.html">Read more...</a></p>
<% coderay :lang => 'ruby' do -%>
require 'rubygems'
require 'hotcocoa'

application do |app|
  win = window :size => [100,50]
  b = button :title => 'Hello'
  b.on_action { puts 'World!' }
  win << b

<h2>Why MacRuby?</h2>
<p>MacRuby began as an attempt to work around many problems inherent in RubyCocoa. In the course of solving these problems, MacRuby has also solved numerous problems in the original implementation of Ruby. Consequently, there are a number of reasons (e.g. convenience, efficiency, flexibility, performance) why one might wish to use MacRuby for new (and ongoing) Ruby applications... <a href="/documentation/why-macruby.html"><br/><i>Read more...</i></a></p>
