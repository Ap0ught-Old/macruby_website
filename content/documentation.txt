Welcome to MacRuby's documentation center.  Here you will find the information you need to get up and running and building OS X applications with MacRuby in no time.  If you have not read the "Introductory Tutorial":/documentation/tutorial.html, its a great way to get started.  If you are wondering why in the world MacRuby exists you can read that in the "Why MacRuby?":/documentation/why-macruby.html page.

MacRuby is a free software project by Apple Inc.  Many folks inside and outside of Apple contribute to this great project and we have a "MacRuby Project Team":/project.html page to list them.  Please also catch up on the latest news by following the "MacRuby Blog":/blog or following the project on the "@macruby":http://twitter.com/macruby Twitter account.

Below are a list of tutorials and recipes for MacRuby.  Tutorials are the longest content and delve deep on a particular area.  Recipes are short and specific examples of how to accomplish something with MacRuby.
