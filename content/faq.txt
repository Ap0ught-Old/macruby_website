You can contribute in a lot of different ways:

<ul class="faq">
  <li>Report issues, bugs, fixes, suggestions using our "ticketing system":http://www.macruby.org/trac/newticket.</li>
  <li>Write tutorials and/or recipes (shorter tutorial) for this website.</li>
  <li>Write or translate sample code that would be bundled and shipped with MacRuby.</li>
  <li>Help with the "RubySpec":http://rubyspec.org/ 1.8 to Ruby 1.9 transition effort.</li>
  <li>Help the specs work using RubySpec and MacRuby's specific specs.</li>
  <li>Port C extensions to the "Ruby FFI API":http://kenai.com/projects/ruby-ffi/pages/Home. (There is a plan to support C extensions in the future, but FFI performance will be better)</li>
  <li>Check the TODO file (in the source code) containing lower level things pending tasks do.</li>
</ul>
